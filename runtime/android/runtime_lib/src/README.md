# Source folder for xwalk_runtime_lib_apk
## Why it's empty
The "xwalk_runtime_lib_apk" is an apk target which
provide xwalk_core_internal_java as library. The purpose
of it is to be shared for other xwalk core embedders.
So there is no java src here.
## Why put me here
To make git keep the folder, the src directory is needed to
build an apk.
